The ioio lab runs a electronics library service. Here you can borrow components and get advice for your projects for free.

## Corona

Right now during the pandemic, things are a bit different but you can still request to borrow components and get advice by email. Just send your request to ioio@ioio.mah.se and we will take care of it as soon as possible.
